 AndroidNotes - Android Opera Link sample application
=====================================================

This is an very simple sample application to manage your Opera Link
notes from your Android phone.

Compilation dependencies
========================
To compile it you'll need the AndroidOperaLink library, available at
http://github.com/operasoftware/androidoperalink

Known issues
============
* When you create a new note or modify a note, switch to another
  application and come back, you lose any unsaved changes
* Deleting notes from *other* clients doesn't make them disappear from
  the Android application
* Authentication doesn't work with Opera Mini, you have to use the
  default browser
* From the note list, if you long-press on a note and select "Delete",
  you get the Preferences dialog instead of getting the note deleted
* The "Synchronize with Opera Notes" option and the "Sync
  Automatically" preference behave a bit erratically
